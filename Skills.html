            <h2>My Skills</h2>
             <p>Out of all the coding languages that I have learned so far, JavaScript is the one I have liked the most. It made my brain rush with new ideas and that is how I started making my own browser-based game.  That is why I think my best skill is JS and I prefer working with that language, my excitement has increased by the fact that I just started learning React. After the winter break I used my HTML and CSS skills in a school project where I had to make a webpage which was designed by the UI/UX students, and I found out that I was not as rusty as I thought I was after a long break.
                 Something that surprised me was that I did not believe I would like to work with Databases very much, but database lessons have become one of my favorites and I quite enjoy working with databases.</p>
